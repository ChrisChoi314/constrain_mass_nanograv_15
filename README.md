# constrain_mass_nanograv_15

The jupyter notebook in this repository shows how the figures in the paper "Constraining Models of Massive Gravity Using the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set" were generated. Some data have to be downloaded from elsewhere, because they were too big for github to store. Make sure to contact mychoi314@gmail.com if there are any questions about how to reproduce any result in the paper.
